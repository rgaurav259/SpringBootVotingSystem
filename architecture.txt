Architecture and Design
This application is built using the Spring framework, specifically the Spring Boot and Spring MVC modules. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and uses RESTful web services to handle HTTP requests.

Modules
The application has the following modules:

CandidateController: This is the main controller class that handles the RESTful endpoints for the voting portal. It uses a HashMap to store the candidates and their vote counts.

Model: This module contains the data model for the candidates and their vote counts.

View: This module contains the views that are returned to the client in response to HTTP requests.

Exception: This module contains custom exceptions for invalid input handling.

Data Storage
The application currently uses a simple in-memory HashMap to store the candidates and their vote counts. This is not suitable for a production environment and a more robust database solution such as MySQL or MongoDB should be used.

Security
The application does not currently include any security features such as authentication or access control. In a production environment, appropriate measures should be taken to secure the application and protect against malicious attacks.

Scalability
The current implementation can handle a limited number of concurrent requests and may not scale well under heavy load. To improve scalability, load balancing and caching should be implemented.

API documentation
The API documentation is provided in the form of comments in the codebase, specifically in the controller class. In a production environment, a separate API documentation tool such as Swagger should be used.
